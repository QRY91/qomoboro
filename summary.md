# qomoboro Rebuild Summary

## Project Evolution

**qomoboro** has been completely rebuilt from a simple pomodoro timer into a comprehensive canonical hours task manager. This transformation aligns with the QRY methodology and provides a systematic approach to productivity tracking.

## What We Built

### Core System
- **Canonical Hours Framework**: Traditional time blocks adapted for modern productivity
- **Triple-Metric Scoring**: Work/Play/Learn scoring system (0-5 scale each)
- **Task Management**: Complete CRUD operations with state tracking
- **TUI Interface**: Clean terminal interface using Charmbracelet tools
- **Data Persistence**: File-based storage with JSON serialization
- **Statistics & Analytics**: Daily and weekly productivity insights

### Key Features

#### Task Management
- Create, update, delete, and view tasks
- Multiple task states: Pending, Active, Completed, Paused, Cancelled
- Time tracking with start/pause/resume functionality
- Multi-dimensional scoring system
- Task scheduling within canonical hours

#### Canonical Hours System
- **Matins** (06:00-07:30): Deep work, planning
- **Lauds** (07:30-09:00): Administrative tasks  
- **Prime** (09:00-12:00): High-focus work blocks
- **Terce** (12:00-13:30): Meetings, collaboration
- **Sext** (13:30-15:00): Lunch, recovery
- **None** (15:00-16:30): Creative work, experimentation
- **Vespers** (16:30-18:00): Learning, documentation
- **Compline** (18:00-20:00): Planning, reflection

#### Scoring Philosophy
Each task receives three independent scores:
- **Work**: Business/professional productivity value
- **Play**: Recreation/leisure/enjoyment factor
- **Learn**: Educational/skill development potential

Tasks can excel in multiple dimensions (e.g., "Code review" might score Work: 4, Play: 2, Learn: 3).

## Interface Design

### Main Navigation
- `[t]` Tasks - View and manage task list
- `[s]` Schedule - View canonical hours
- `[d]` Statistics - Productivity analytics
- `[c]` Create - Add new task
- `[g]` Settings - Configuration (future)
- `[r]` Refresh - Reload data
- `[q]` Quit - Exit application

### Task List Operations
- `↑/↓` or `k/j` - Navigate tasks
- `Enter` - View task details
- `Space` - Toggle completion status
- `c` - Create new task
- `d` - Delete selected task
- `q/Esc` - Return to main menu

### Color-Coded Interface
- **Primary Green** (`#688060`): Work-related elements
- **Accent Yellow** (`#F0DFAF`): Headers and highlights
- **Secondary Blue** (`#8CD0D3`): Learn-related elements
- **Error Red** (`#DCA3A3`): Error states
- **Muted Gray** (`#7F7F7F`): Secondary information

## Development Workflow

### Makefile Commands
```bash
make build        # Build the binary
make quick        # Format, build, and run
make test         # Run test suite
make ci           # Complete CI pipeline
make run-dev      # Run with development data
make install      # Install system-wide
make backup       # Create data backup
```
